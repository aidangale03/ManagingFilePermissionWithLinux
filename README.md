<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Google Docs</b>
- <b>Linux</b>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I changed multiple permissions to match the level of authorization my organization wanted for files and directories in the projects directory. The first step in this was using ls -la to check the permissions for the directory. This informed my decisions in the following steps. I then used the chmod command multiple times to change the permissions on files and directories.
